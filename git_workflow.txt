No one works in master

At merge into master time:

** owner of branch to be merge handle merge conflicts

** after creating pull request pull request owner needs to comment on the request
  to alert other group members (no github email generated when pull request happens)

** any migrations or budle install things need to be noted in pull request comments

1. look at pull request online
2. comment either with an okay OR if there is an issue
3. once everyone has commented merge branch

After the merge into master

1. (commit changes on current branch)
2. go to master and pull
3. go back to your branch and merge master into your branch

** IF you can't get to a pull request quickly you can slack us to check in about it
